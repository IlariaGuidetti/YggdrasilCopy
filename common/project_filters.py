"""Project-driven filter configuration for the shared patient-list filter bar.

Projects only collect a subset of what the platform supports: ``tf4_testset``
collects CBCT + panoramic and voice captions, nothing else. A filter for data a
project never gathers is noise that always returns nothing, so the filter bar is
built from the project's own ``Modality`` and ``AnnotationMethod`` sets rather
than from a per-domain hardcoded list.

Shared by ``maxillo.views.patient_list`` (also serving laparoscopy) and
``brain.views.patient_list``, which render the same
``common/partials/patient_list_content.html``.
"""

# Annotation-presence filters, keyed by the AnnotationMethod slug that has to be
# enabled for the project before the filter is offered. ``modality``, when
# present, additionally requires that modality: IOS landmarks are impossible
# without IOS scans.
#
# ``key`` is the DOM id prefix static/js/patient_list.js binds to. 'reports' is
# the one legacy key (its hidden input is `reportsFilterValue`, special-cased in
# that script); everything else follows the `<key>_value` convention.
