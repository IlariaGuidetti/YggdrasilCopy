Promoted from ``maxillo.file_utils`` in Phase 5.1 so sibling apps stop reaching
into maxillo private helpers. These are domain-agnostic: they resolve a Patient's

The domain branching in ``entity_fk_kwargs``/``domain_for_patient`` is inherited
as-is; the registry-driven rewrite lands in Phase 5.2 (``common/domains.py``).
